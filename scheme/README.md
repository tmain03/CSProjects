# Scheme Interpreter
This is my Scheme Interpreter!

It was coded entirely in Python. This task helped me prove quite a few things.

1. My understanding of Scheme. I am not an advanced Scheme user, but this project
helped solidify my knowledge of Scheme syntax, builtins, and procedures.

2. My understanding of interpreters. Building this project helped me get some
insight into the inner workings of an interpreter and how they work.

3. My Python skills!

I contributed to the following files. scheme_eval_apply.py, scheme_forms.py, scheme_classes.py, questions.scm
