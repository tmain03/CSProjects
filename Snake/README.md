# Snake
This is my version of Snake.
This is the first project I've utilized the language C.

Memory management was a new concept to me, so understanding pointers, accessing memory addresses, mallocing and freeing
were all new concepts to me. 

Otherwise, this project was mostly used to get used to C syntax, which isn't identical to Java or Python.

I did not complete this program in its entirety.
State.c contains methods that I wrote.
