# This is my version of the game 2048
# I did not create this in its entirety

# As a class project, I was given the game2048 file and tasked with completing the "Model" class.
# The Model class essentially dictates the rules of the game, from how to win, how to lose, and how to move.

# The biggest challenge with this project was the "Tilt" method, specifically preventing tiles from merging
# when they've already merged in a turn.
