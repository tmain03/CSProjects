# 2048
This is my version of the game 2048
I did not create this in its entirety

As a class project, I was given the game2048 file and tasked with completing the "Model" class.
The Model class essentially dictates the rules of the game, from how to win, how to lose, and how to move.

The biggest challenge with this project was the "Tilt" method, specifically preventing tiles from merging
when they've already merged in a turn.

There were a lot of moving pieces in this assignment that were hard to keep track of, but being one of the first
projects I worked on in Java, I could probably do a bit better now.
